Assignment 1 - Quick Task App with Back4App Integration

Set Up Back4App
Created a new app - 'Quick Task'
Created a new class ‘Task’ with columns title, description, status

Then installed flutter and completed setup in system
Created new flutter project 'Quick Task'
Added dependency ‘parse_server_sdk’ in pubspec.yaml
Refer Application ID and Client Key from Back4App and update the same in main.dart file for establishing connectivity between Back4App and Flutter

Implemented functions like addToDo(), getToDo(), updateToDo(), deleteToDo() in main.dart file for CRUD operartions

Create Tasks, get list of tasks, update task, delete task functionality is working as expected when user performs from Frontend (Flutter) and verified the same in Backend (Back4App)
Also, same validation has been verified successfully by modifying data at Backend (Back4App) and same got reflected on Frontend (Flutter)
